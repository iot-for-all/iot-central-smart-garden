Be sure to assemble your Micro: Climate Kit before starting, for instructions on assembly follow Sparkfun's assembly guide here: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-meter-hookup-guide

## Wiring
With your Climate Kit assembled following the guide in the previous section, the wiring for this project becomes very simple<br>
<ul>
  <li> Simply plug the two wires from the climate kit into the appropiatly marked RAIN and WIND Sockets on the Weather:Bit and slot your micro:bit into the slot on the top. </li>
  <li> From there take your USB to micro USB and plug the micro end into the micro:bit and the USB end into the Raspberry Pi </li>
  <li> Plugging the battery pack into the micro:bit is optional, but unnessecary as the Raspberry Pi will power it </li>
  <li> Once you plug in your Raspberry Pi everything is set up and ready to run the code. </li>
