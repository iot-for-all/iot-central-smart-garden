# IOT Central Smart Garden
Using IoT Central for enabling a smart garden

This project is split up into two seperate parts, Moisture Sensor and Climate Kit
## Moisture Sensor
This section focuses around using the capacitive moisture sensors, using these sensors we will create an automatic watering system.<br>
This section takes far more different parts to do

## Climate Kit
This section focuses around using the micro:Climate kit to create a weather station that we can use to send data to IOT Central.<br>
This section uses far fewer parts than the previous
